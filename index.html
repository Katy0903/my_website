          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello everyone, I am Katy, and I am from <em>Taiwan</em>. I have
            been in Canada for about <em>5 years</em> and I think Canada is
            really a <em>beautiful</em> country.

            I used to work as a banker in Victoria and North Vancouver. Victoria
            is a good place to travel and relax, meanwhile, the
            <em>weather</em> is pretty good there.

            I am interested in computer information area and that is why I am
            here to BCIT. I found it <em>attractive</em> when I learn new things
            from the courses. I wish myself to <b>pass all</b> the courses and
            have perfect grades on all of them.
          </p>
