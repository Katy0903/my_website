        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello everyone, I am Katy, and I am from <b>Taiwan</b>. I have been in Canada for about <em>5 years</em> and I think Canada is really a <em>beautiful</em> country. 
                <br>
                I am interested in computer information area and that is why I am here to BCIT. I found it <em>attractive</em> when I learn new things from the courses. 
                I wish myself to pass all the courses and have perfect grades on all of them.</p>
